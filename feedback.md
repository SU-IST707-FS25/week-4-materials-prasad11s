## Problem Breakdown

### Exercise 1 (4/16 = 25.0%)

**Part pipeline-part1** (pipeline-part1.code): 0/0 points

_Feedback:_ Good PCA usage: 2D projection is correct and colors by label. Minor issues: you ignore the provided train/test split; consider using X_mnist_train and y_mnist_train. Also reuse the same PCA for reduction/reconstruction and visualize the reconstruction for completeness.

**Part pipeline-part2** (pipeline-part2.code): 1/4 points

_Feedback:_ You performed PCA and plotted a scree chart, but the task requires a 2D PCA reduction and a scatter plot colored by class. Please set n_components=2, transform X, and scatter X_pca[:,0] vs X_pca[:,1] with c=y and a colormap, as in your prior work.

**Part pipeline-part3** (pipeline-part3.code): 1/4 points

_Feedback:_ You computed cumulative variance and the #components for 95%, but you did not create the required scree plot. Missing: visualization, limiting to first 40 components, and y-axis as percent variance explained. Use PCA(n_components=40) and plot explained_variance_ratio_*100 vs 1..4

**Part pipeline-part4** (pipeline-part4.code): 1/4 points

_Feedback:_ You performed PCA and reconstruction, but you did not calculate or derive the number of components for 95% variance. Hard-coding 149 doesn’t show how it meets the 95% threshold. Compute cumulative explained variance and pick n where it first reaches 0.95 (or use n_components_95).

**Part pipeline-part5** (pipeline-part5.code): 1/4 points

_Feedback:_ Your code trains KNN and evaluates PCA with 80% variance, but it does not visualize a digit as required. You should use the dimensions from Step 4 (149 PCs), reconstruct a digit via inverse_transform, and plot it (e.g., plot_mnist_digit(reconstructed_digit)).

### Exercise 2 (9/10 = 90.0%)

**Part ex1-part1** (ex1-part1.code): 4/4 points

_Feedback:_ Good t-SNE visualization. Using a 2k subset is reasonable; coloring by labels and plotting works. For potentially better separation, you could try different perplexity values or slightly larger subsets, but your solution meets the task well.

**Part ex1-part2** (ex1-part2.code): 2/3 points

_Feedback:_ Good job training KNN on your t-SNE features and reporting accuracy. However, you evaluated on the training data only, which overestimates performance. Split into train/test (or use cross-validation) on X_tsne to measure generalization. Imports not penalized.

**Part ex1-part3** (ex1-part3.code): 3/3 points

_Feedback:_ Good job: you trained KNN on your UMAP features and computed accuracy correctly. Note this is training accuracy (optimistic); a holdout/test score would be more informative.

### Exercise 4 (11/14 = 78.6%)

**Part ex2-part1** (ex2-part1.code): 0/0 points

_Feedback:_ Good start: PCA to 2D, KNN accuracy, and a scatter plot. To meet the task: also try multiple PCA dimensions, add UMAP with different n_neighbors/min_dist and dimensions, evaluate impact on KNN using a train/test split, and visualize each projection. Avoid training accuracy only.

**Part ex2-part2** (ex2-part2.code): 4/7 points

_Feedback:_ You implemented DR+KNN correctly but used UMAP instead of PCA as required and as in your prior work. The pipeline and plot are fine. To align with the task, replace UMAP with PCA (e.g., PCA(n_components=2)) and reuse your prior PCA workflow.

**Part ex2-part3** (ex2-part3.answer): 7/7 points

_Feedback:_ Clear, accurate comparison. You correctly report higher KNN accuracy with UMAP and explain why (nonlinear, preserves local structure) vs PCA’s linear projection causing overlap. Good interpretation consistent with your prior work. Nice job.
